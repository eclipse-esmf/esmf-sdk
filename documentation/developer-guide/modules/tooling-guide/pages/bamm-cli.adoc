= BAMM CLI

The BAMM CLI is a command line tool for the validation of Aspect models and the generation of artifacts, such as documentation or code, from Aspect models.

TIP: Download latest version: icon:download[] https://github.com/OpenManufacturingPlatform/sds-sdk/releases/download/v{sds-sdk-version}/bamm-cli-{sds-sdk-version}.jar[bamm-cli-{sds-sdk-version}.jar]

[[bamm-cli-getting-started]]
== Running the BAMM CLI

For the executable jar, call `java -jar bamm-cli-{sds-sdk-version}.jar` followed by one of the following subcommands ( e.g., `java -jar bamm-cli-DEV-SNAPSHOT.jar help`).
In the following sections, `bamm-cli` will be used as the command name.

Successful execution of a command is signaled by returning 0. In case of logical or some other internal problem error code 1 is returned.
Missing or wrong command parameters result in error code 2 being returned.

To get help for a certain subcommand, add 'help' before the subcommand name or add `--help` to the end, e.g., `bamm-cli help aspect`
or `bamm-cli aspect --help`.
Each subcommand can have its own set of options which allow the user to further fine-tune the execution of the command.
The available options and their meaning can also be seen in the help text of the individual subcommands.

== Using the CLI to create a JSON OpenAPI Specification

Every specification is based on one Aspect, which needs a separately defined server URL where the given aspect will be.
The URL will be defined as string with the `-b` option, i.e.: https://www.example.org.
The default URL, using the above defined --api-base-url, would result in https://www.example.org/api/v1/\{tenantId}/<aspectName>.
By default the Aspect's local name is used as path.
The default path can be manipulated with the `--resource-path` switch.
If the path is defined further, for example `--resource-path "/resources/\{resourceId}"`, the resulting URL would be: https://www.example.org/api/v1/\{tenantId}/resources/\{resourceId}.

It will be required to specify the parameter, in case there is an additional parameter defined.
This has to be in JSON or in YAML, depending on the kind of specification chosen.
For example:
With the option `--resource-path "/resources/\{resourceId}"` the generator constructs the URL https://www.example.org/api/v1/\{tenantId}/resources/\{resourceId}
and then the `--parameter-file` defines the parameter resourceId in yaml:

----
resourceId:
  name: resourceId
  in: path
  description: An example resource Id.
  required: true
  schema:
    type: string
----

The full command would result in:

[source,shell,subs="attributes+,+quotes"]
----
java -jar bamm-cli-{sds-sdk-version}.jar aspect _AspectModel.ttl_ to openapi -b "https://www.example.org" -r "/resources/\{resourceId}" -p _fileLocation_

[[models-directory-structure]]
== Understanding the models directory structure

An Aspect model file can contain an Aspect definition as well as other model elements that are defined in the same versioned namespace, as described in the xref:bamm-specification:ROOT:namespaces.adoc[Namespaces section of the
specification].
Additionally, it is possible to split one versioned namespace across multiple files, for example to define a Characteristic that is usable in multiple Aspects into its own file.
In order for BAMM CLI to be able to resolve references to such externally defined model elements, the model files must be organized in a directory structure as follows:

`_namespace_/_version_/_name_.ttl`

where _namespace_ corresponds to the hierarchical namespace that is part of the model element's URN, e.g.
`com.mycompany.myproduct` and _version_ corresponds to the version of the namespace.
The resulting directory structure then looks like the following:

[source,subs=+quotes]
----
_models root_
└── com.mycompany.myproduct
    ├── 1.0.0
    │   ├── MyAspect.ttl
    │   ├── MyEntity.ttl
    │   └── myProperty.ttl
    └── 1.1.0
        └── MyAspect.ttl
----

The name of the directory shown as _models root_ above can be chosen freely.
The BAMM CLI will resolve the file path relative to the input file by following the folder structure described above.
Each of the files in the `1.0.0` directory should therefore have an empty prefix declaration such as `@prefix : <urn:bamm:com.mycompany.myproduct:1.0.0#>`.
