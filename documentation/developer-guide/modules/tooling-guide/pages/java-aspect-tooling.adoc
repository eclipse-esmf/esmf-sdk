[[aspect-model-java-tooling]]
= Java Tooling for Working with Aspect Models

[[general-considerations]]
== General Considerations

In this section, the Java APIs for working with Aspect Models are described. All of the components described in the
following subsections can either be included in your project using a dedicated dependency (as described in the
respective subsection), _or_ you can use the `aspect-model-starter` artifact that aggregates all necessary dependencies:

include::sds-developer-guide:ROOT:partial$sds-aspect-model-starter-artifact.adoc[]

The error handling in many APIs is done using the
`https://javadoc.io/doc/io.vavr/vavr/0.9.2/io/vavr/control/Try.html[Try]` type provided by the Java library _Vavr_. This
is similar to a `java.lang.Optional` in that a successful result can be processed using `.map()` or `.flatMap()`, but if
an error occurs, the object can also provide the original exception. Compared with throwing exceptions, using a `Try<T>`
as a return type instead has the advantage of enabling composable and better readable code. Please see the
https://www.vavr.io/vavr-docs/[Vavr User Guide] for more information.

[[parsing-aspect-model-urns]]
== Parsing Aspect Model URNs

The `aspect-model-urn` artifact provides a way to parse and validate Aspect model element URNs as described in the
xref:bamm-specification:ROOT:namespaces.adoc[specification].

[source,java]
----
import io.openmanufacturing.sds.aspectmodel.urn.AspectModelUrn;

final AspectModelUrn urn = AspectModelUrn.fromUrn( "urn:bamm:com.example:1.0.0#Example" );

System.out.println( urn.getNamespace() ); // com.example
System.out.println( urn.getName() );      // Example
System.out.println( urn.getVersion() );   // 1.0.0
System.out.println( urn.getUrnPrefix() ); // urn:bamm:com.example:1.0.0#
----

To include the artifact, use the following dependencies:

include::sds-developer-guide:ROOT:partial$sds-aspect-model-urn-artifact.adoc[]

[[loading-and-saving]]
== Loading and Saving Aspect Models

Aspect models are, like their Meta Model, described using the Resource Description Format (RDF,
xref:bamm-specification:appendix:appendix.adoc#rdf11[[rdf11\]]) and the Terse RDF Triple Language syntax (TTL,
xref:bamm-specification:appendix:appendix.adoc#turtle[[turtle\]]). There are two ways of working with Aspect models:
Either the model is loaded as an RDF model where the abstraction level directly corresponds to the RDF/Turtle
serialization, or the RDF is parsed into a native Java Aspect model representation where the abstraction level
corresponds to the BAMM concepts. Both approaches have different use cases and advantages and both are supported by the
Aspect model Java tooling:

[width="100%", options="header", cols="50,50"]
|===
| Working on the RDF level | Using the Java Aspect model
a|
* Low level, focus on power and flexibility
* Flexibly navigate and filter the model on the RDF statements level
* Work with models that are valid RDF, but incomplete Aspect models, e.g. in Aspect model editors
* Use SPARQL xref:bamm-specification:appendix:appendix.adoc#sparql[[sparql\]] to execute complex queries on Aspect models
a|
* High level, focus on convenience and type-safety
* Use Aspect-model specific interfaces for type-safe code
* Use Java-native data types (e.g. `java.math.BigInteger` for `xsd:integer`)
* Easily traverse the model on the abstraction level of Aspect model elements
|===

As a rule of thumb, if your use case mostly consists of _consuming_ Aspect models, you should prefer the Java Aspect
model, if you _create_ or _edit_ Aspect models, this is better done using the RDF API.

[[understanding-model-resolution]]
=== Understanding Model Resolution

Loading an Aspect model in either the RDF-based or the Java Aspect model-based APIs does not only comprise parsing the
Turtle file, but also the resolution of elements on the RDF level:

* An Aspect model refers to meta model elements (everything that starts with `bamm:`), and can refer to namespaces of
  shared elements (`bamm-c`, `bamm-e` and `unit`)
* It can also refer to elements from other Aspect models or model elements defined in separate Turtle files

You use the _model resolver_ to load an Aspect model, which takes care of the first point: The used meta model elements
and elements from shared namespaces are automatically resolved and added to the loaded RDF model. For the second point,
you need to provide the model resolver with the information on where to find other Aspect models: In memory, in a local
file system, in a remote model repository etc. This is done using a _resolution strategy_, which is a function from some
type `T` to a `Try` of a RDF model. Several commonly used resolution strategies are readily available:

* The `FileSystemStrategy` resolves a `java.nio.file.Path` for a file relative
  to the xref:tooling-guide:bamm-cli.adoc#models-directory-structure[models directory]
* The `UrnFileSystemStrategy` resolves a
  <<parsing-aspect-model-urns,AspectModelUrn>> to a file in the xref:tooling-guide:bamm-cli.adoc#models-directory-structure[models directory]
* The `InMemoryStrategy` resolves a model against an already loaded Apache Jena RDF model
* The `SequenceStrategy` can be used to chain two different strategies of the same type
* The `EitherStrategy` can be used to chain two different strategies of different types

To implement custom resolution strategies (e.g., to resolve models against a different blob storage API), you can base
your implementation on the `AbstractResolutionStrategy`. Using the model resolver requires at least one resolution
strategy that can resolve `AspectModelUrn`&#8203;s (because references in an Aspect model to external model elements use
their respective URNs) and can use another resolution strategy, for example for file paths. The following sections show
examples for the different variants.

[[loading-an-aspect-model-rdf-level]]
=== Loading an Aspect Model to work on the RDF Level

Consider the following example:

include::sds-developer-guide:ROOT:partial$sample-loading-aspect-model-rdf.adoc[]

To include the model resolver artifact, use the following dependencies:

include::sds-developer-guide:ROOT:partial$sds-aspect-model-resolver-artifact.adoc[]

[[loading-an-aspect-model-java-model-level]]
=== Loading an Aspect Model to work on the Java Aspect Model Level

Consider the following example:

include::sds-developer-guide:ROOT:partial$sample-loading-aspect-model-java.adoc[]

To include the Java Aspect model artifact, use the following dependencies:

include::sds-developer-guide:ROOT:partial$sds-aspect-meta-model-java-artifact.adoc[]

[[serializing-an-aspect-model]]
=== Serializing a Java Aspect Model into a RDF/Turtle Aspect Model

There are two serialization components available: One to turn a Java Aspect model into a Jena RDF model (the reverse
operation of what the `AspectModelLoader` does) and one to serialize the resulting Jena RDF model in Turtle syntax,
formatted according to the guidelines described in the BAMM specification.

include::sds-developer-guide:ROOT:partial$sample-serializing-aspect-model.adoc[]

To include the serializer artifact, use the following dependencies:

include::sds-developer-guide:ROOT:partial$sds-aspect-model-serializer-artifact.adoc[]

[[validating-aspect-models]]
== Validating Aspect Models

Consider the following example:

include::sds-developer-guide:ROOT:partial$sample-validating-aspect-model.adoc[]

To include the model validator, use the following dependencies:

include::sds-developer-guide:ROOT:partial$sds-aspect-model-validator-artifact.adoc[]

[[generating-documentation]]
== Generating Documentation for Aspect Models

Different types of artifacts can be generated from an Aspect model. All corresponding generators are included in the
following dependency:

include::sds-developer-guide:ROOT:partial$sds-aspect-model-document-generators-artifact.adoc[]

The documentation generation APIs provide methods that take as an argument a `Function<String, java.io.OutputStream>`.
This is a mapping function that takes a file name as an input (which is determined by the respective generator) and
returns a corresponding `OutputStream`, for example (but not necessarily) a `FileOutputStream`. By providing this
function when calling the generator method, you can control where the output is written to, even when the generator
creates multiple files. For the code examples in the following subsections, we assume that the following method is
defined for calling the generators:

[source,java]
----
OutputStream outputStreamForName( final String aspectFileName ) {
   // Create an OutputStream for the file name, e.g. a FileOutputStream
   ...
}
----

[[generating-diagrams]]
=== Generating SVG or PNG Diagrams

Using the `AspectModelDiagramGenerator`, automatically layouted diagrams can be created for Aspect models in the formats
PNG, SVG and https://www.graphviz.org/[Graphviz/DOT].

include::sds-developer-guide:ROOT:partial$sample-diagram-generation.adoc[]

[[generating-html-documentation]]
=== Generating HTML Documentation

A HTML reference documentation for an Aspect model can be generated as shown in the following code sample. The
documentation contains an overview diagram and describes the model elements as specified in the Aspect model. Preferred
names and descriptions in the respective language from the Aspect model are shown in the resulting document as part of
each model element.

include::sds-developer-guide:ROOT:partial$sample-html-generation.adoc[]

[[generating-sample-json-payload]]
=== Generating Sample JSON Payload

The sample JSON payload generator is used to create a valid JSON payload for an Aspect model as it could be returned by
an Aspect that implements that Aspect model. This follows the
xref:bamm-specification:ROOT:payloads.adoc#mapping-to-json[mapping rules] as defined in the Meta Model specification.
The generator uses `bamm:exampleValue`&#8203;s of Properties if present, otherwise random values corresponding to the
respective data types are generated.

include::sds-developer-guide:ROOT:partial$sample-json-payload-generation.adoc[]

=== Generating JSON Schema

The JSON schema generator creates a https://json-schema.org/[JSON Schema] that describes the payload for an Aspect model
as it could be returned by an Aspect that implements that Aspect model. Currently, the generated schema corresponds to


include::sds-developer-guide:ROOT:partial$sample-json-schema-generation.adoc[]

=== Generating OpenAPI Specification

The OpenAPI specification generator creates either a https://json-schema.org/[JSON Schema] or a https://yaml.org/[Yaml Spec]
that specifies an Aspect regarding to the https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/[OpenApi specification].
The currently used versions corresponds https://json-schema.org/specification-links.html#draft-4[Draft 4] of the JSON Schema specification,
and https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/3.0.1/versions/3.0.1.md[3.0.1].

include::sds-developer-guide:ROOT:partial$sample-openapi-generation.adoc[]

NOTE: For Enumerations with complex data types, the values are modelled as instances of the Entity defined as the
Enumeration's data type (see {bamm-documentation-url}/v{aspect-meta-model-version}/modeling-guidelines.html#declaring-enumerations[Declaring Enumerations]
in the Modelling Guidelines for more information). In case the Entity instances contain Properties with a sorted collection
as their data type, the order of the values of said collection in the Entity instances is not preserved in the generated
OpenAPI specification. Preserving this order in OpenAPI is not possible at this point.

[[generating-java-code]]
== Generating Java Code for Aspect Models

Java code can be generated from an Aspect model in two ways:

. The generated code represents the Aspect payload. Aspects and Entities become Java classes; their Properties become
fields in the classes. Characteristics are not first-class elements, but are implicitly represented by the usage of
corresponding data types (e.g. using `java.util.Set` as the type for the `Set` Characteristic of a Property) or
`javax.validation` annotations. The generated classes can be used in a straightforward fashion, but they do not contain
information about the underlying Aspect model such as its version number. Parts of the Aspect model that have no
representation in its corresponding JSON payload are not part of those classes either, in particular descriptions and
preferred names. These classes are called POJOs (Plain Old Java Objects), as they do not contain logic but serve mainly as data containers.

. The generated code represents the Aspect model itself: It is a type-safe variant of the model and includes every
information that is also present in the model such as Characteristics, descriptions including language tags and original
XSD data types. It is however not intended to store payload corresponding to an Aspect. Theses classes are called static
meta classes, because they are created at compile time (_static_) and talk about the structure of the information, not
the information itself (_meta_).

Depending on the use case, you would either use one or both of the types simultaneously.

To include the Java generator, use the following dependencies:

include::sds-developer-guide:ROOT:partial$sds-aspect-model-java-generator-artifact.adoc[]

[[type-mapping]]
=== Type Mapping

In the Java code generated from an Aspect model, the scalar Aspect model
xref:bamm-specification:ROOT:datatypes.adoc#data-types[data types] are mapped to native Java types. The following table
lists the correspondences.

[width="100%", options="header", cols="50,50"]

| Aspect model type | Java native type
| `xsd:string`  | `java.lang.String`
| `xsd:boolean` | `java.lang.Boolean`
| `xsd:decimal` | `java.math.BigDecimal`
| `xsd:integer` | `java.math.BigDecimal`
| `xsd:double` | `java.lang.Double`
| `xsd:float` | `java.lang.Float`
| `xsd:date` |  `javax.xml.datatype.XMLGregorianCalendar`

[[generating-pojos]]
=== Generating POJOs

POJO generation is straightforward; there are two minor differences to the generation of documentation artifacts.
Firstly, when instantiating the generator, you pass a flag indicating whether
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson_(API)[Jackson] annotations should be generated in the class. Secondly, the name
mapping function passed to the generation method takes a `QualifiedName` instead of a String, so that you can decide how
to handle the package structure of the class.

include::sds-developer-guide:ROOT:partial$sample-pojo-generation.adoc[]

[[generating-static-meta-classes]]
=== Generating Static Meta Classes

For the generation of static meta classes, consider the following example:

include::sds-developer-guide:ROOT:partial$sample-static-meta-class-generation.adoc[]

To use the generated static meta classes, you need the following additional dependency:

include::sds-developer-guide:ROOT:partial$sds-aspect-static-meta-model-java-artifact.adoc[]

[[migrate-meta-model-version]]
== Programmatically migrate the Meta Model Version

The meta model version migrator provides functionality to automatically migrate an Aspect model that uses an older
version of the Aspect Meta Model to an Aspect model that uses a newer (usually the latest) version of the meta model.

This is shown in the following sample:

include::sds-developer-guide:ROOT:partial$sample-meta-model-version-migration.adoc[]

To use the meta model version migrator, you need the following dependency:

include::sds-developer-guide:ROOT:partial$sds-aspect-meta-model-version-migrator-artifact.adoc[]

[[accessing-bamm-programmatically]]
== Accessing the BAMM programmatically

In order to access the source RDF files that describe the BAMM vocabulary, shared Characteristics and Entities as well
as Units, you can add a dependency to the `aspect-meta-model` artifact. Note that this artifact does not contain any
Java classes.

include::sds-developer-guide:ROOT:partial$aspect-meta-model-artifact.adoc[]

In order to access the files via `java.lang.Class#getResourceAsStream`, you can refer to the following directory
structure that is present in the artifact:

[source,subs="attributes+,+quotes"]
----
.
├── characteristic
│   └── {aspect-meta-model-version}
│       ├── characteristic-definitions.ttl
│       ├── characteristic-instances.ttl
│       ├── characteristic-shapes.ttl
│       └── characteristic-validations.js
├── entity
│   └── {aspect-meta-model-version}
│       ├── FileResource.ttl
│       ├── ThreeDimensionalPosition.ttl
│       └── TimeSeriesEntity.ttl

│       └── type-conversions.ttl
└── unit
    └── {aspect-meta-model-version}
        └── units.ttl
----

TIP: If you use the artifact `aspect-model-resolver` instead (see section <<loading-and-saving>> for infos on the
dependency) you can directly refer to the RDF files using a resource URL:

[source,java]
----
import java.io.InputStream;
import java.net.URL;
import java.util.Optional;
import io.openmanufacturing.sds.aspectmodel.resolver.services.AspectMetaModelResourceResolver;
import io.openmanufacturing.sds.aspectmodel.resolver.services.MetaModelUrls;
import io.openmanufacturing.sds.aspectmetamodel.KnownVersion;
import io.openmanufacturing.sds.aspectmodel.vocabulary.BAMM;

final KnownVersion metaModelVersion = KnownVersion.BAMM_1_0_0;
final AspectMetaModelResourceResolver resolver = new AspectMetaModelResourceResolver();
final Optional<URL> characteristicDefinitionsUrl =
      MetaModelUrls.url( "characteristic", metaModelVersion, "characteristic-instances.ttl" );
characteristicDefinitionsUrl.ifPresent( url -> {
   final InputStream inputStream = resolver.openUrl( url );
   resolver.loadTurtle( inputStream ).forEach( model -> {
      // Do something with the org.apache.jena.org.rdf.model.Model
      final BAMM bamm = new BAMM( metaModelVersion );
      final int numberOfCharacteristicInstances =
            model.listStatements( null, RDF.type, bamm.Characteristic() ).toList().size();
      System.out.println( "Meta Model Version " + metaModelVersion.toVersionString()
            + " defines " + numberOfCharacteristicInstances + " Characteristic instances" );
   } );
} );
