# SDS Aspect Meta Model Java

The `sds-aspect-meta-model-java` module provides the Java implementation for the BAMM Aspect Meta Model, or BAMM.
Each Meta Model element and each Characteristic class is represented by an interface with a corresponding implementation.

Additionally, an Enumeration containing all available units is provided. See `Units.java`.
The `Units` Enumeration is generated by the `unit2java.groovy` script which is executed during the build of this module.

## Usage

The Meta Model can be instantiated as follows using the provided `AspectModelLoader`.

```
Aspect aspect = AspectModelLoader.fromInputStream( new FileInputStream( "Aspect.ttl" ) );
```
