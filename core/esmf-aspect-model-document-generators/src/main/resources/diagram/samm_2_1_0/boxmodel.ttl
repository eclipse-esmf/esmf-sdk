# This file defines the elements of the intermediary format for generating diagrams,

# So, from an Aspect model, a graph such as the following is created (and subsequently processed
# into a tool-specific diagram representation, in our case Graphviz dot format, by boxmodel2dot.sparql):
#
# :AccelerationAspect  a  :Box ;
#         :entries    ( [ a       :Entry ;
#                         :text   "CISS Acceleration Aspect" ;
#                         :title  "preferredName"
#                       ]
#                       [ a       :Entry ;
#                         :title  "description" ;
#                         :text   "The Acceleration Aspect"
#                       ]
#                     ) ;

# ... etc.

:Box a rdfs:Class .

:Edge a rdfs:Class .

:Entry a rdfs:Class .

# Boxes have prototypes

:prototype a rdf:Property .

# Boxes, Edges and Entries have titles

:title a rdf:Property .

# Boxes have either a list of entries (rdf:List of Entry, preserves order),

:entries a rdf:Property .

# or alternatively a set of Entrys

:entry a rdf:Property .

# Boxes can specify an overriding color

:fillcolor a rdf:Property .

# Entries have texts

:text a rdf:Property .

# Edges have source (from) and destinations (to)

:from a rdf:Property .

:to a rdf:Property .
